I created this in regards to another project (related to Google Voice) that I am working on.
However, it would seem that a Google Voice binding (done in Python) already exists that
not only matches but exceeds current features. Although I had intended on introducing most
of said features and had a similar coding style in mind, I see no point in simply duplicating
their code.

The project I am referencing is called pygooglevoice and can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/pygooglevoice/. See my blog for more information at
